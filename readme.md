## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([retext][]) plugin to check indefinite articles
(`a` and `an`).
It’s more complex than checking vowels, as it has to do with sounds.
This package knows about how digits are pronounced as well.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you’re dealing with content that might contain
grammar mistakes, and have authors that can fix that content.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-indefinite-article
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import retextIndefiniteArticle from 'https://esm.sh/retext-indefinite-article@4'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import retextIndefiniteArticle from 'https://esm.sh/retext-indefinite-article@4?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our document `example.txt` contains:

```txt
He should, a 8-year old boy, should have arrived a hour
ago on an European flight.
An historic event, or a historic event? Both are fine.
```

…and our module `example.js` contains:

```js
import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
import retextIndefiniteArticle from 'retext-indefinite-article'
import retextStringify from 'retext-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextIndefiniteArticle)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .process(await read('example.txt'))

console.error(reporter(file))
```

…now running `node example.js` yields:

```txt
example.txt
1:12-1:13 warning Unexpected article `a` before `8-year`, expected `an`   retext-indefinite-article retext-indefinite-article
1:50-1:51 warning Unexpected article `a` before `hour`, expected `an`     retext-indefinite-article retext-indefinite-article
2:8-2:10  warning Unexpected article `an` before `European`, expected `a` retext-indefinite-article retext-indefinite-article

⚠ 3 warnings
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is
[`retextIndefiniteArticle`][api-retext-indefinite-article].

### `unified().use(retextIndefiniteArticle)`

Check `a` and `an`.

###### Parameters

There are no parameters.

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

## Messages

Each message is emitted as a [`VFileMessage`][vfile-message] on `file`, with
`source` set to `'retext-indefinite-article'`, `ruleId` to
`'retext-indefinite-article'`, `actual` to the unexpected word, and `expected`
to suggestions.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`retext-indefinite-article@^4`,
compatible with Node.js 12.
